# git-tool

Script to automate common git command sequences

TODO:

   better error logging

   increased count accuracy without sacrificing robustness

   refactor some of the code to be less janky

   maybe make another abstraction layer between InShellGitEditor and the subprocess module?

   make a nice readme

   standardize ' vs "

   add tests
